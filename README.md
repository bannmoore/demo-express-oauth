# Oauth using Express

This is a demo Express app that implements OAuth / OpenID Connect through Okta. Most of the code is boilerplate generated by [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) and can be largely ignored.

Here are the important bits:
- `lib` contains the auth code
- `test` contains tests for the auth code (WIP)
- `app.js` imports the `auth` dependency and adds some routes specifically around the auth workflow

## Getting the Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bannmoore/node-express-auth.git
cd node-express-auth
npm install
```
